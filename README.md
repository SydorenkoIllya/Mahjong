Implement logic and UI for a Mahjong-like game.

The objective of the game is to collect cards until no card is hidden.  User picks a card and if its value matches the value of a previously selected card, both cards change state to “visible”.

A card can have a value in (1,60) range and must be a prime number. (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 etc.)
Two pairs with identical values are not allowed, they must be unique. Array of prime numbers must be generated dynamically.
